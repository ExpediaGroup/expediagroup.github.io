# EG Open Source Portal

This is the source code for the Expedia Group Open Source portal, a website for discovering EG open source projects.
See the live version [here](https://expediagroup.github.io/).

## Technologies

This is a statically-rendered website using [Docusaurus v2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/).
You need Node.js 14 or later.
The produced static files are distributed as `GitHub Pages`.

## Local Development

First install Node.js modules with:

```console
npm install
```

Then start with:

```console
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

Alternatively, you can build the site with:

```console
npm run build
```

then serve locally the content of the `build` directory with:

```console
npm run serve
```
